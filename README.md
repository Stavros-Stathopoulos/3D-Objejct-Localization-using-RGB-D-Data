# 3D-Objejct-Localization-using-RGB-D-Data
3D Object Localization pipeline using RGB-D data, it handles a live feed from an RGB-D camera, uses YOLO to extract and contain within a bounding box the features of interest, then SAM extracts the silhuette of the object and creates a mask over it and finally using depth data, a depth map is created.
